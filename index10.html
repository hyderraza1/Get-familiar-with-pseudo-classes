  <h2>1. Petra</h2>
  <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/education/childrens-corner/Petra.jpg" alt="petra" class="petra">
  <div id="O"><h3><b>On the edge of the Arabian Desert, Petra was the glittering capital of
     the Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV (9 B.C. to 40 A.D.). Masters of water technology, 
     the Nabataeans provided their city with great tunnel constructions and water. <br>
     <br>A theatre, modelled on Greek-Roman prototypes, had space for an audience of 4,000. <br>      
     <br>Today, the Palace Tombs of Petra, with the 42-meter-high Hellenistic temple facade on
     the El-Deir Monastery, are impressive examples of Middle Eastern culture. <br>
     <br>UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". 
     Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.
     Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.

  <div id="E"><h3><b>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. <br>
     <br>The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. <br>
     <br>Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). <br>
     <br>To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. <br>
     <br>It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. <br>
     <br> Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.

  <div id="O"><h3><b>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. <br>
     <br> Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (69-79 AD) in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (79-81 AD). <br> 
     <br>Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81-96 AD). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre. <br>
     <br>It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, etc. <br>
     <br>Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.

     <br>The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site. <br>
